## Summary 
The analysis shows that bike sharing services are used most by male users and during rush hour times, Monday through Friday. Females use bike 
sharing services more on the weekends. The typical duration for bike usuage is less than an hour per instance. Geographically, usuage is heaviest
in the heart of the city where tourism is highest and so is traffic. Further analysis is recommended to-
1) compare the overall population of DesMoines compared to NYC broken down by gender and age,
2) compare the tourist attractions within the city of the Des Moines with a scale of distances between them on a map visualization.
